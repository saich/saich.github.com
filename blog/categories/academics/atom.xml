<p>I couldn&rsquo;t believe my eyes seeing that grade report of mine&hellip; I was not at all expecting those things.. those &lsquo;A&rsquo; Grades in Mathematics-II and Engineering Mechanics, &lsquo;Not F&rsquo; in Basic Mechanical Science&hellip;..</p>

<p>When my friend Krishna called me 5 days ago and said my grades,I did not really believe him&hellip; I thought he was just kidding (Sorry Krishna! Never mind it!). My thought strengthened when I went to net to check out the results on my own but found no results&hellip;</p>

<p>But, a question is arising in my mind (better say, heart): Do I deserve those grades for the things I learnt?? ( They r too little).. Is there any student in our college who deserves the grades he obtained?.. Is this the kind of education we get in such a prestigious college??</p>

<p>Yes, this lenient kind of valuating the student&rsquo;s brains(also their future) should not be followed. Else, our society could never move forward &amp; our students won&rsquo;t get what they deserve&hellip;..</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/hell.jpg" title="This is  the Hell !!" alt="This is  the Hell !!" /></p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m typing these words, I could feel energy flowing through my fingertips for this long-awaited day has atlast come. I have just finished writing those (useless) exams of my (worthless) 1st yr. 2nd sem..</p>

<p>This sem has been quite contrary to its previous one, in which fun and joy flowed everywhere. These 18 weeks, I felt I was in hell. Senseless &amp; vigorous ragging, mental torture of attendance shortage problem and those dreadful exams (minors, mids &amp; ends) were the gifts I received during this hell-stay.</p>

<p>Even those end exams, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d clear all subjects, put aside the SGPA. I doubt if Basic Mechanical Science (BMS) would pull me back into this hell for the suppli.</p>

<p>Now its time for me to enjoy and to implement my plans I had for these hols from last 6 months:</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete the Max Payne-I</li>
<li>Design a website for myself</li>
<li>Gain on some weight.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hope I could accomplish them&hellip;&hellip;</p>
