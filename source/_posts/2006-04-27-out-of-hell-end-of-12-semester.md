![This is  the Hell !!](/images/hell.jpg "This is  the Hell !!")

As I'm typing these words, I could feel energy flowing through my fingertips for this long-awaited day has atlast come. I have just finished writing those (useless) exams of my (worthless) 1st yr. 2nd sem..

This sem has been quite contrary to its previous one, in which fun and joy flowed everywhere. These 18 weeks, I felt I was in hell. Senseless & vigorous ragging, mental torture of attendance shortage problem and those dreadful exams (minors, mids & ends) were the gifts I received during this hell-stay.

Even those end exams, I'm not sure if I'd clear all subjects, put aside the SGPA. I doubt if Basic Mechanical Science (BMS) would pull me back into this hell for the suppli.

Now its time for me to enjoy and to implement my plans I had for these hols from last 6 months:

1. Complete the Max Payne-I
2. Design a website for myself
3. Gain on some weight.

Hope I could accomplish them......
