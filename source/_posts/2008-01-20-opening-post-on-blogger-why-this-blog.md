Hi readerz !!!  
Previously, I used to blog on Yahoo! 360&deg; at [http://360.yahoo.com/saiprasad_35](http://360.yahoo.com/saiprasad_35). But I found something was missing in it .... it was myself ... my ideaz, my views were missing the point ..... So, I deleted all posts from that blog and decided to start over again ....

Why Blogger this time?? As usual, Google excels in its services in raw form and I felt more inclined to it....

Whats about the post in it?? They are mirror images of my thoughts, my achievements, my opinions and completely myself....

Hope you find yourself comfortable going through my blog....

Good Day,  
Sai Prasad Ch
