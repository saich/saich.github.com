sorry guyz for keeping you waiting for almost a week time ......  
The last week, it was a complete festive and a busy week for me (along with all in my college), for the wekend was Technozion '08 the Annual Technical Fest of NIT, Warangal....
The most important event for TZ '08 was the visit of the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam to our college...
This visit was the main factor to attract large masses of people towards participating in TZ'08 making it a big success......

But, coming to my point of view, TZ'08 doesn't deserve it.. The TZ website ([http://www.technozion.org/](http://www.technozion.org/)) couldn't be worse in any dimension. No event was upto the point of excellence and couldn't reach the expectations.

But this time, the accommodation and other facilities provided to the visitors was far better compared to the last year ....  
Anyways, the TZ is finished for this year and the organization of the fest for the next year is in our batch's hand... Hope we do better .... : -)
