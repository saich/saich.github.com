Today, a senior shares his experience about experience at IBM ISL for intern last summer.. Some suggestions from him about the IBM ISL Intern I'm about to take in this summer :<br /><ul><li>Do the documentation on regular basis on par with the coding.</li><li>Also, include "Problems Faced By Me" during development in documentation</li><li>Listen to technical seminars well.... They have to form base for you final year project.</li><li>Interact with the team for seminars. Also, get contact details if possible and stay in touch with them</li><li>Have a good relationship with your technical mentor.</li><li>Don't return to college without Pre Placement Offer (PPO).</li></ul>
