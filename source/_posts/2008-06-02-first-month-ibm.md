A month passed by.... Got the stipend into bank account... But, still no hands on my project.... My mentor has been busy all these days. Even he works most of the days remote ( from home ).<br />So, my daily routing had been to :<br /><ul><li>Start to office at 9.10 AM</li><li>Have breakfast at the IBM Food Court by 9:55 AM</li><li>Go to my desk by 10:10 AM</li><li>Check my mails, scraps, posts etc.</li><li>Have a cup of Coffee</li><li>Lunch 12:45 PM to 1:45 PM</li><li>A coffee again at 3:00 PM</li><li>Again a sip of coffee at 4:30 PM</li><li>Back to room at 7:00 PM</li><li>Have dinner on the way.</li><li>Watch the IPL match</li><li>Late night sleep<br /></li></ul>And the day starts over again!<br /><br />So boring routine right??? Hmmm... feel the same but couldn't help without any work....<br /><br />-- Sai Prasad.
