Hi!<br /><br />My first earning reached my account 3 days ago... It really feels good to have your first earning coming into your hands.... I was happy ( take it as superlative degree of joy)..... Its not a big amount ( just 14000+ bucks) but still I was happy.... No work and still you get paid... Who wouldn't love it??<br /><br />I decide not to save any part from that..... And also not to spend it on anyone else.... Just ME.....<br />i wanna spend it all for myself....... The immediate next day, we all (Praveen, Suresh &amp; me) rushed to B.F. (Brand Factory).... Got hands on all kind of things there ......<br /><br />Its really a good thing to : SHOP AS YOU WISH &amp; SWIPE YOUR VISA....<br /><br /><br />hehe... Time for my cup of coffee ..)<br /><br />Sai Prasad.
