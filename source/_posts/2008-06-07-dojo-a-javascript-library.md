Been trying to look into <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org">Dojo Toolkit</a> for a few days... The features are good and I wondered why it wasn't the No.1 ??? But, as days passed, I found a few worse things with that toolkit......<br /><ul><li>It was heavy-weight toolkit.</li><li>It loads all the JS files (summing to 700KB) even though not at all necessary...</li><li>Requires a high efficient system .. An ordinary system cannot work well Dojo ...<br /></li><li>It takes up all the RAM of the system, hanging the system for a while....</li></ul>So, I thought its better to shift to some other toolkit --- May be JQUERY is better ......<br />Let me try that also....<br /><br /><br />Sai Prasad
