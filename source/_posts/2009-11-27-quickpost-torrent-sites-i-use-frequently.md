A quickpost to announce the torrent sites I use regularly (and of vourse, I like them)
<ol>
	<li> <a title="Vertor - Verified Torrents" href="http://www.vertor.com">http://www.vertor.com</a> Its the home for verified torrents. Hence, you need not worry about fake torrents. It also have screenshots and an audio sample. And the best thing, it does not need any registration and almost ad-free. :-)</li>
	<li><a title="Telugu Torrents" href="http://www.telugutorrents.net ">http://www.telugutorrents.net </a>As name suggests, its dedicated for Telugu, a regional language in India (and also my mother tongue). Good part about this site is: Only good quality (dvdrip) videos are allowed to be posted here and no place in here for camrips, which is a good feature as far as I'm concerned. Also, downloads happen with a very good speed. Sad thing is it is open for registered users only, and registrations are closed now !! :-(</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.tollytorrents.com">http://www.tollytorrents.com</a> Again, a telugu only site, but contains all the entertainment stuff (like, music, dvdrips, camrips, wallpapers etc.) . Though requires registration, registrations are free &amp; open. Downloads happen at a good speed. By the way, I started using this site today only :-)<a href="http://www.tollytorrents.com">
</a></li>
</ol>
<strong>Update 1: </strong>One of my browser addon blocks all the ads on webpage, and hence can't assure the *ad-free* I announced for Vertor.

<strong>Update 2: </strong>A little clarification: 'tolly' in tollytorrents refer to tollywood which refers to movie industry of Telugu.
