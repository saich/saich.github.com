This is video of the speech by the famous J.K. Rowling at the Harvard Commencement, 2008.

So, whats in the video?

- It has some humor in it, especially the first 150 secs. I'm sure a few smiles you'd certainly escape from your tender lips.. :P
- She talks how 'being poor' influences (or atleast attempt to) your life and all in it including career, passion etc. etc.
- And the core part - The benefits of failure. I think she had put this part in action in a great way, or else, after watching this video, why did I desperately want to fail in a big way despite my fear of failure??

Now that I mentioned I fear failure, let me tell what my mind tells me right now. "You do not fear the failure itself, but your fear its after-effects. Its capable of taking everything fro you !". But my heart is encouraging me - "When you had done everything from scratch, why do you fear to do it again? It'd easier this time.. !!" :P :P

I know it sounds funny, but really can't help. Perhaps, this is why people call -
