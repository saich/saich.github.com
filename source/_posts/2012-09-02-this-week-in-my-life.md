title: 'This week in my life'

---

This is really getting ridiculous.. My last post on this blog was 4 months ago, and the one before that 9 months ago.. This is not how I meant to do things.. This is also not the way things are supposed to go... Its true that more than sometimes, it is very hard, time-taking and exhaustive to put your thoughts on paper (err, keyboard)..  But, if I keep doing it at this pace, this blog shall do more harm to me than any good. Its time this thing changes... So, from this week, I shall put something like a weekly report which shall contain sharing things I found interesting, what I'm thinking hard etc...  Hopefully, this shall become a habit, a good habit actually...

<strong>Geekiness infiniti (You can never run out of geekiness :P)</strong>
<ul>
	<li>As much as I hate Internet Explorer, this article <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/08/22/the-innovations-of-internet-explorer/">The Innovations of Internet Explorer</a> reminded (and taught) me how it was a really innovative game changer at that time, without which the browsers wouldn't have been today where they are are.. Seriously, Internet Explorer seems like it threw away a whole new world of opportunity.</li>
	<li>Stumbled upon usage of !function(){}(). Looks cleaner than (function(){})().. From now onwards, I'm using this ! preceding style for all my anonymous functions in Javascript. I can save a byte too... More details at:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3755606/what-does-the-exclamation-mark-do-before-the-function"> What does the exclamation mark do before the function?</a></li>
	<li>This answer on Quora changed all my perspective on Ph.D. and research-oriented educations. I was always in favor of breadth than depth, but this post convinces me that depth is the way to reach limits and beyond.<span class="quora-content-embed" data-name="Philosophy/How-do-I-remind-myself-that-I-know-nothing/answer/Prasanna-Madhavan/quote/15186">Read <a class="quora-content-link" href="http://www.quora.com/Philosophy/How-do-I-remind-myself-that-I-know-nothing/answer/Prasanna-Madhavan/quote/15186" data-width="575" data-height="4888" data-embed="vQYqyYA" data-type="quote" data-id="15186" data-key="8406a3e7ea9306047c76e9ce0e2e8aca">Quote of Prasanna Madhavan's answer to Philosophy: How do I remind myself that I know nothing?</a> on <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a><script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.quora.com/widgets/content"></script></span></li>

<strong>Non-technical musings</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/08/18/a-good-place-to-work/">A Good Place to Work</a> - The author (a CEO) explains why having regular 1:1s is a must to make your workplace better. He even went further to forcing his managers to have regular 1:1s (or else get fired). This seems ridiculous to me - Companies claim of open-door policy, and the same companies ask for formal 1:1 discussion. If you have open-door policy, and you discuss everything with your manager in general in day-to-day life, what else can you talk about in the 1:1, except for staring at each other? The right thing seems to be to ensure the right communications (in any way) between employees and managers, but remember that 1:1s doesn't work for everyone (that includes me).</li>
	<li><a href="http://gtoosphere.blogspot.in/2012/08/so-i-was-wishing-flawsophy-for-his.html">So I was wishing @flawsophy for his birthday...</a> - Funny, but with insights into the current state of wishing on birthdays in India. Its true, there is no more bigger insult than <em>not</em> wishing him/her on his/her birthday. And if you two are in relationship, expect a break-up message if you are not the first and last to wish them "Happy birthday".. Oh, there is also a <strong>non-bailable Birthday Offence</strong>. Seriously, whats wrong with people? As if you are getting a new beginning every year on your birthday?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Garbage inside my mind</strong>

How do you take a good decision in life? You can never be sure. You can either choose a decision and pray that it will turn out to be good decision (which has 0.5 probability). Else, put all your effort to make sure this decision turns out to be a good one.

Limited time - All I've got is limited time. The piled up pending tasks shows how important it is for me to manage my limited time properly. Its time to take Time Management seriously, any tips here would be appreciated..

Ahh... end of the post.. See you next week my dear blog...
