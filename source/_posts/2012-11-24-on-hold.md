title: 'On Hold'

---

After much thought, I've decided to put this blog on hold for a while... Let me list the excuses I've behind this decision:
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: 18px;">I'm busy, and unable to allocate time to this.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 18px;">I've moved away from PHP, and this blog runs on PHP.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 18px;">Writing is not the skill I have.</span></li>
</ol>
<div></div>
<div><span style="line-height: 18px;">But what's the actual reason?</span></div>
<div>
<ol>
	<li><span style="line-height: normal;">Commitment - seems like I lack it w.r.t this blog. You can see this from the inconsistent gaps between the posts.</span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: normal;">A lot of things are pending in my queue for a long time. Its time to trim down some areas, so that I focus on the better things.</span></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I hope this is temporary, and would come back to this sonner. Until then, adieu.</div>
