    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi!<br /><br />My first earning reached my account 3 days ago&hellip; It really feels good to have your first earning coming into your hands&hellip;. I was happy ( take it as superlative degree of joy)&hellip;.. Its not a big amount ( just 14000+ bucks) but still I was happy&hellip;. No work and still you get paid&hellip; Who wouldn&rsquo;t love it??<br /><br />I decide not to save any part from that&hellip;.. And also not to spend it on anyone else&hellip;. Just ME&hellip;..<br />i wanna spend it all for myself&hellip;&hellip;. The immediate next day, we all (Praveen, Suresh &amp; me) rushed to B.F. (Brand Factory)&hellip;. Got hands on all kind of things there &hellip;&hellip;<br /><br />Its really a good thing to : SHOP AS YOU WISH &amp; SWIPE YOUR VISA&hellip;.<br /><br /><br />hehe&hellip; Time for my cup of coffee ..)<br /><br />Sai Prasad.</p>

Hmmm&hellip; feel the same but couldn&rsquo;t help without any work&hellip;.<br /><br />&mdash; Sai Prasad.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi !<br />At last, I&rsquo;ve started to Bangalore for my Intern @ IBM, Bangalore. Couldn&rsquo;t get reservation on train so had to take a bus. Its really a hectic journey .. 18 hours of continuous journey in a bus &hellip;<br />I reached Bangalore @ 6 am but had to wait for my friend Praveen to arrive there (hez also an intern) whoz coming by train .. The train got delayed and came at 11.45 keeping me waiting all that time &hellip;.<br /><br />The first problem faced is ACCOMMODATION. We went on searching for that for two complete days and finally got settled in an house&hellip;.<br /><br />Coming to office part, its pretty cool&hellip;. Its different from what I expected&hellip; People are having fun there&hellip;.. Got my PC (worst kind) at the end of my first week.<br />Waiting for  my project to begin &hellip;.<br />Sai Prasad</p>
