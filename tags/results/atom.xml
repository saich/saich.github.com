<p>As I&rsquo;m typing these words, I could feel energy flowing through my fingertips for this long-awaited day has atlast come. I have just finished writing those (useless) exams of my (worthless) 1st yr. 2nd sem..</p>

<p>This sem has been quite contrary to its previous one, in which fun and joy flowed everywhere. These 18 weeks, I felt I was in hell. Senseless &amp; vigorous ragging, mental torture of attendance shortage problem and those dreadful exams (minors, mids &amp; ends) were the gifts I received during this hell-stay.</p>

<p>Even those end exams, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;d clear all subjects, put aside the SGPA. I doubt if Basic Mechanical Science (BMS) would pull me back into this hell for the suppli.</p>

<p>Now its time for me to enjoy and to implement my plans I had for these hols from last 6 months:</p>

<ol>
<li>Complete the Max Payne-I</li>
<li>Design a website for myself</li>
<li>Gain on some weight.</li>
</ol>


<p>Hope I could accomplish them&hellip;&hellip;</p>
