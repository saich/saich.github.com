    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You begin at the Square One, you go forward with hopes and dreams, and most importantly with no idea what the future holds for you. You go non-stop until that day comes when completely unexpected happens, and you&rsquo;ll be just thrown out back on to Square One.</p>

<p>You get dejected, depressed and lose all your hopes that everything got ruined. You live in darkness of the past, until one day you say to yourself &ldquo;Enough! You got to get moving&rdquo;&hellip; And, you start moving into that unknown future, with fear still in your mind&hellip;. You try to take one step at a time, but you haven&rsquo;t gotten over your prior experiences. Yet, when you start getting over past and start moving forward with confidence, it happens again! You&rsquo;ll land in the Square One again, now with no knowledge on how, when and why&hellip;.</p>

<p>This time, you begin your journey again into those unknown lands, but instead of fear, this time you have that strange confidence &ndash; &ldquo;Not to fear&hellip; I can get over even if the worse happens again!&rdquo;</p>
