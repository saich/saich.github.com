## Guidelines for self for next job

- Don't accept or decline an offer immediately, even if you are very sure. Take at least 24-48 hours before making a final confirmation.
- As you get older, money is going to be very important. Understand all the details of salary (breakup is also important) & stock options (vesting period, valuation etc). Make sure you are going to receive documents for both of them.
- Make sure the company is looking for humans, not robots.
- Make sure the company understands that humans do have opinions.
- Tolerance: 20 days of "Quit this Job"
